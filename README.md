## Why Splitwriter?

This program exists for one purpose: **to support comfortable, uninterrupted writing.**

- No account, no network, no cloud lock-in.
- Simple but powerful split layout for text, references, and management.
- Just enough features for long-form creative work, without turning into a full office suite.

If you want a small notebook-like tool for novels, scripts, or journals, Splitwriter is for you.

## Key Features

### Core Design

- **Complete Security**  
  Splitwriter works fully offline. It does not collect user information or require an internet connection.

- **Factory Initialization**  
  You can reset presets and settings by deleting the configuration files — a “factory reset” is always possible.

- **Free Forever**  
  Licensed under MIT and intended to remain free for personal and commercial creative work.

### Boards

- **Text Board**  
  Preset-based text editor for comfortable writing. Switch between headline/body/accent/emphasis presets for different parts of your manuscript.

- **Echo View (Cinematic Preview)**
  Instantly preview the selected text in a clean, full-screen, visual-novel-style layout.
  Echo View can display your text alone against a dark background, or combine it with the current reference image to create a scene-like presentation.
  Perfect for reviewing dialogue, checking flow, practicing readings, or preparing YouTube/lecture scripts.

- **Image Board**  
  An image viewer for description and reference. Images are **referenced by path only** and are not embedded into the `.swon` file.

- **Viewer Board**  
  Open another `.swon` file side-by-side in a read-only view to reference older drafts or notes.

- **Manage Board**  
  Organize your `.swon` projects and user data in one place.

### Layout & Interaction

- **Flexible Layout**  
  Free horizontal/vertical splitting of panes with minimum-size guards.  
  Double-click a split handle to snap panes to a clean 50 / 50 layout.

- **Typewriter Mode**  
  Keeps the current line at a comfortable height while you type, so your eyes don’t have to chase the cursor.

- **Accent Color**  
  A single accent color that instantly changes the overall mood of the editor.

### Writing Utilities

- **Auto Save**  
  Timer-based autosave using seconds. Your work is automatically saved at regular intervals.

- **Curly Braces Replacement**  
  For writers who rarely use `{ }`, Splitwriter can replace them with more writing-friendly symbols.

- **Writing Goal HUD**  
  A small heads-up display that shows your current progress toward a writing goal.

- **Undo / Redo**  
  Per-board history for both text and image edits (up to 20 steps, including selection restore).
